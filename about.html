                I’m Dawit, a passionate student currently studying 
                at the School of Information and Technology Engineering, 
                Addis Ababa University. Alongside my studies, I work as a 
                freelance web developer and data analyst, blending my 
                academic knowledge with real-world projects to deliver 
                impactful solutions.

            <h2>My Journey</h2>
            <p>
                My journey in tech began during two transformative summers 
                at AddisCoder, where I delved into Python and web development. 
                These experiences laid the foundation for my skills and inspired 
                my passion for solving problems through technology. Since joining 
                Addis Ababa University, I’ve been building on that foundation, 
                exploring deeper aspects of information technology and engineering.

            <p>
                <img src="images/image3.jpg" alt="personal photo">
                I’m deeply motivated by the work I do. Problem-solving and design are not 
                just skills I practice but passions that bring me immense satisfaction. 
                Whether it’s tackling a technical challenge or finding innovative ways to 
                improve user experiences, I’m always eager to rise to the occasion.

            <h2>Beyoned Tech</h2>
            <p>
                Education is a cause close to my heart—I truly believe in its power to change 
                the world. That’s why I currently tutor lower-grade students, sharing my knowledge 
                and contributing to their growth. In my free time, I dive into psychology books, 
                fueled by a curiosity to understand human behavior and a desire to help others 
                improve their lives.

            <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
            <p>
                My mission is to continue leveraging technology to solve real-world problems and make 
                a difference. Whether through building efficient web solutions, analyzing complex data, 
                or exploring how education and technology intersect, I’m excited about the journey ahead.
